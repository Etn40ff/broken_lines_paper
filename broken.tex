\section{Introduction}

Cluster algebras are commutative rings with partial bases of a special form, originally discovered in the context of dual canonical bases in Lie theory \cite{FZ}.  Their axiomatics encapsulates the fact that many kinds of canonical bases in nature have large subsets which are governed by a uniform combinatorics.  Elements of these subsets are monomials in distinguished elements called cluster variables, which are grouped into overlapping collections called clusters.  Each cluster has an associated skew-symmetrizable matrix, and the entire cluster algebra can be reconstructed recursively from any particular cluster along with this matrix.

A fundamental issue in the theory is understanding natural completions of the partial basis of cluster monomials to a full basis of a cluster algebra.  Depending on the context, this question can be analyzed from a wide range of perspectives drawn from representation theory, geometry, combinatorics, and mathematical physics \cite{Dup,KQ,FG,MSW,BZ,Rup,GMN}.  Generally one expects any cluster algebra to admit several natural bases related in potentially subtle ways.  A basic example of this is the relationship between the dual canonical and dual semicanonical bases of the coordinate ring of the positive unipotent subgroup of a simple algebraic group \cite{GLS}.  This example illustrates in particular that in general it is nontrivial to tell even whether or not two constructions of canonical bases in a cluster algebra lead to the same result.  The purpose of the present paper is to compare two such constructions for cluster algebras associated to skew-symmetrizable matrices of rank 2.  

The first basis we consider is the greedy basis of \cite{LLZ}.  Every cluster algebra is contained in the ring of Laurent polynomials in the cluster variables of any of its clusters.  The recently-confirmed positivity conjecture, proved in the rank 2 case \cite{LS,Rup2} and in the general case in \cite{LS2,GHKK}, asserts that the coefficients of the Laurent expansion of any cluster variable are positive integers.  The greedy basis is defined so that all of its elements, not just cluster variables, have positive Laurent expansions in any cluster and that the coefficients of any such Laurent expansion are as small as possible.  The resulting coefficients turn out to enumerate combinatorial objects called compatible pairs related to maximal Dyck paths.

The second basis we consider is the theta basis of \cite{GHKK}.  Unlike the
greedy basis it is defined for cluster algebras of arbitrary rank.  In fact,
this basis is a special case of a much more general construction, based on two
concepts. The first is that of scattering diagram introduced in \cite{KS} in two
dimensions and in \cite{GS} in all dimensions. The second is a combinatorial
notion of broken line, introduced in \cite{G10} with their theory further
developed in \cite{CPS} and then \cite{GHK11}.  The coefficients of Laurent
expansions of the elements of this basis enumerate broken lines, which morally
capture the geometry of holomorphic disks in the mirror cluster variety.  Broken
lines are piecewise-linear paths in a tropicalization of the cluster variety,
whose points of non-linearity lie along the scattering diagram.  This diagram
encodes the relations among cluster transformations, or among elements of the
tropical vertex group.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a rank 2 cluster algebra.  The greedy and theta bases of $\mathcal{A}$ coincide.
\end{theorem}

The proof is based on an analysis of the Newton polygons of elements of the theta basis.  It can be shown that elements of the greedy basis are essentially determined by which coefficients of their Laurent expansion are nonzero.  That is, if an element of $\mathcal{A}$ is Laurent in three adjacent clusters and has the same support as a greedy basis element in any particular Laurent expansion, it must in fact coincide with that element up to a scalar.  Thus to show that elements of the theta basis are elements of the greedy basis, it suffices to establish certain bounds on the behavior of broken lines rather than explicitly enumerating them.

The organization of the paper is as follows.  In sections 2 and 3 we review the basic definitions and properties of the greedy and theta bases, respectively.  The natural parametrizing sets of the two bases, the $\bfd$-vectors and $\bfg$-vectors, are distinct, and in section 4 we explain how to relate them.  This determines a bijection between the two bases, and in section 5 we show that the basis elements mapped to each other by this bijection actually coincide, proving the main theorem.

\section{Rank 2 cluster algebras and their greedy bases}
Fix positive integers $b,c$ and consider rational functions $x_k\in\QQ(x_1,x_2)$ indexed by $k\in\ZZ$ and defined recursively by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exchangerelations}
  x_{k-1}x_{k+1}=
  \begin{cases}
    x_k^b+1 & \text{if $k$ is odd;}\\
    x_k^c+1 & \text{if $k$ is even.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
These functions are called \emph{cluster variables} and the \emph{cluster
algebra} $\cA(b,c)$ is the $\ZZ$-subalgebra of $\QQ(x_1,x_2)$ which they
generate.  Each pair $\{x_k, x_{k+1}\}$ is called a \emph{cluster} and a monomial in $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$ is called a \emph{cluster monomial}.  Later we will denote by $M$ a rank 2 lattice with an algebra isomorphism $\ZZ[M] \cong \ZZ[x_1^{\pm1},x_2^{\pm1}]$.  Writing elements of $\ZZ[M]$ as $x^m$ for $m \in M$, this induces an isomorphism $M \cong \ZZ^2$, $m \mapsto (m_1,m_2)$ via $x^{(m_1,m_2)} = x_1^{m_1}x_2^{m_2}$.

An essential result about the relations \eqref{eq:exchangerelations} is that they imply that $\cA(b,c)$ is in fact a subalgebra of $\ZZ[x_1^{\pm1},x_2^{\pm1}]$ rather than merely a subalgebra of $\QQ(x_1,x_2)$.
\begin{theorem}\label{th:Laurent}
\cite[Theorem~3.1]{FZ} Given any cluster variable $x_j$, we have $x_j\in\ZZ[x_k^{\pm1},x_{k+1}^{\pm1}]$ for every $k \in \ZZ$.
\end{theorem}

We will denote by $\ZZ_{\ge0}[x_k^{\pm1},x_{k+1}^{\pm1}]$ the subspace of Laurent polynomials with positive coefficients.  An element of $\cA(b,c)$ is a 
 \emph{universal Laurent polynomial} (resp.  \emph{positive universal Laurent polynomial}) if it is contained in 
 $\ZZ[x_k^{\pm1},x_{k+1}^{\pm1}]$ (resp. $\ZZ_{\ge0}[x_k^{\pm1},x_{k+1}^{\pm1}]$) for every $k \in \ZZ$.

\begin{theorem}
\cite{LS} Each cluster variable of $\cA(b,c)$ is positive.
\end{theorem}

An element of $\ZZ[x_1^{\pm1},x_2^{\pm1}]$ is called \emph{pointed at
$(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ^2$} if it can be written in the form
\[
  x_1^{-a_1}x_2^{-a_2}\sum\limits_{p_1,p_2\ge0}c(p_1,p_2)x_1^{bp_1}x_2^{cp_2},
\]
where $c(p_1,p_2)\in\ZZ$ with $c(0,0)=1$.   
%We will call such an element \emph{positive in the first cluster} if $c(p_1,p_2)\ge0$ for all $p_1,p_2\ge0$. 
\begin{prop}\cite[Proposition~1.5]{LLZ}
  Let $z$ be pointed at $(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ^2$ and suppose
  $z\in\ZZ_{\ge0}[x_0^{\pm1},x_1^{\pm1}]
  \cap\ZZ_{\ge0}[x_1^{\pm1},x_2^{\pm1}]
  \cap\ZZ_{\ge0}[x_2^{\pm1},x_3^{\pm1}]$.
  Then the pointed coefficients $c(p_1,p_2)$ satisfy the following recursive
  inequality:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:consecutive positivity inequality}
    c(p_1,p_2)\ge\max\bigg(
    &\sum\limits_{k=1}^{p_1} (-1)^{k-1}c(p_1-k,p_2){a_2-cp_2+k-1\choose k},\\
    \nonumber&\sum\limits_{ j =1}^{p_2} (-1)^{ j -1}c(p_1,p_2- j ){a_1-bp_1+ j -1\choose  j }\bigg).
  \end{align}
\end{prop}
A positive element of $\cA(b,c)$ is called \emph{indecomposable} if it cannot
be written as a sum of two positive elements.  In the search for positive bases
of $\cA(b,c)$ one is naturally led to investigate the indecomposable positive
elements.  A sufficient condition for a positive pointed element to be
indecomposable is the inequality \eqref{eq:consecutive positivity inequality}
being an equality.  It turns out that this requirement alone uniquely determines
a collection of elements of $\cA(b,c)$ with nice properties.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:greedy}\cite[Theorem~1.7]{LLZ}
  For any $(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ^2$ there exists a unique indecomposable positive
  element $x[a_1,a_2]\in\cA(b,c)$ which is pointed at $(a_1,a_2)$ and whose
  pointed coefficients satisfy the recursion
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:greedy recursion}
    c(p_1,p_2)=\max\bigg(
    &\sum\limits_{k=1}^{p_1} (-1)^{k-1}c(p_1-k,p_2){a_2-cp_2+k-1\choose k},\\
    \nonumber&\sum\limits_{ j =1}^{p_2} (-1)^{ j -1}c(p_1,p_2- j ){a_1-bp_1+ j -1\choose  j }\bigg).
  \end{align}
  Moreover, the collection $\{x[a_1,a_2]:(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ^2\}$ is a basis of
  $\cA(b,c)$ which contains the cluster monomials and is independent of the
  choice of an initial cluster.
\end{theorem}
We will call $x[a_1,a_2]$ the \emph{greedy element} pointed at $(a_1,a_2)$ and
call $\{x[a_1,a_2]:(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ^2\}$ the \emph{greedy basis} of $\cA(b,c)$.  \sayGM{Sentence added here for segway. (Gregg)} We now switch our point of view and consider ordinary support rather than pointed support.

Given a Laurent polynomial $f=\sum_{m\in M}c_mx^m$ in $\ZZ[x_1^{\pm1},x_2^{\pm1}]$, the \emph{support} of $f$ is the set
\[ \{m\in M \mid c_m\neq 0\} \]
and the \emph{Newton polygon} of $f$ is the convex hull in $M\otimes\mathbb{R}$ of the support of $f$.\sayGM{ISSUE: Newton polygons are inherently convex; but the region in Figure 1.6b is not.  We may need to replace "Newton polygon" with some terminology which allows a \emph{choice} of polygon containing the support. (Greg)}
\sayGM{If we switch all uses of 'Newton polygon' to 'support', does this solve the issue?  This makes it closer to [LLZ]'s exposition. (Gregg)}

\begin{theorem}\label{th:Newton polygons}\cite[Proposition~4.1]{LLZ}, \cite[Corollary 3.5]{LLZ2}
  For $(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ^2$, the Newton polygon of $x[a_1,a_2]$ is determined as follows.
  \begin{enumerate}
    %\item If $a_1 \leq 0$ and $a_2 \leq 0$, then $R_{a_1,a_2} = \{(0,0)\}$.
    \item If $a_1 \leq 0$ and $a_2 \leq 0$, then $N_{a_1,a_2} = \{(-a_1,-a_2)\}$.
    %\item If $a_1 \leq 0 < a_2$, then $R_{a_1,a_2} = \{(p_1,0): 0\leq p_1\leq a_2\}$.
    \item If $a_1 \leq 0 < a_2$, then $N_{a_1,a_2} = \{(p_1,-a_2): -a_1\leq p_1\leq -a_1+ba_2\}$.
    %\item If $a_2 \leq 0 < a_1$, then $R_{a_1,a_2} = \{(0,p_2): 0 \leq p_2 \leq a_1\}$.
    \item If $a_2 \leq 0 < a_1$, then $N_{a_1,a_2} = \{(-a_1,p_2): -a_2 \leq p_2 \leq -a_2+ca_1\}$.
    %\item If $0<ba_2\leq a_1$, then $R_{a_1,a_2}=\left\{(p_1,p_2)\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2\big|\; p_1\le a_{2},\; p_2\le a_{1}-bp_1\right\}$.
    \item If $0<ba_2\leq a_1$, then $N_{a_1,a_2}=\left\{(p_1,p_2): -a_1\le p_1\le -a_1+ba_2,\; -a_2\le p_2\le -a_2-cp_1\right\}$.
    %\item If $0<ca_1\leq a_2$, then $R_{a_1,a_2}=\left\{(p_1,p_2)\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2\big|\; p_2\le a_{1},\; p_1\le a_{2}-cp_2\right\}$.
    \item If $0<ca_1\leq a_2$, then $N_{a_1,a_2}=\left\{(p_1,p_2): -a_1\le p_1\le -a_1-bp_2,\; -a_2\le p_2\le -a_2+ca_1\right\}$.
    %\item If $0 < a_1 < ba_2$ and $0 < a_2 < ca_1$, then
    %$$\aligned
    %R_{a_1,a_2}=&\bigg\{(p_1,p_2)\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2\bigg|\; 0\le p_1<\frac{a_1}{b},\; p_2+\Big(b-\frac{ba_2}{ca_1}\Big)p_1<a_1\bigg\}\\
    %&\bigcup\bigg\{(p_1,p_2)\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2\bigg|\; 0\le p_2<\frac{a_2}{c},\; p_1+\Big(c-\frac{ca_1}{ba_2}\Big)p_2<a_2\bigg\}\\
    %&\hspace{1.35em}\bigcup\Big\{(0,a_1),(a_2,0)\Big\}.
    %\endaligned
    %$$
    \item If $0 < a_1 < ba_2$ and $0 < a_2 < ca_1$, then
    $$\aligned
    N_{a_1,a_2}=&\bigg\{(p_1,p_2)\bigg|\; -a_1\le p_1<0,\; -a_2\le p_2<\Big(\frac{a_2}{a_1}-c\Big)p_1\bigg\}\\
    &\bigcup\bigg\{(p_1,p_2): -a_1\le p_1<\Big(\frac{a_1}{a_2}-b\Big)p_2,\; -a_2\le p_2<0\bigg\}\\

    \endaligned
    $$
  \end{enumerate}
  Moreover, if $z\in\cA(b,c)$ is any element containing the monomial $x_1^{-a_1}x_2^{-a_2}$ with coefficient 1 and whose Newton polygon is contained in that of $x[a_1,a_2]$, then $z=x[a_1,a_2]$.

\begin{proof}
  The first part is the content of \cite[Proposition~4.1]{LLZ} and \cite[Corollary 3.5]{LLZ2}.

  Suppose $z\in\cA(b,c)$ is pointed \sayGM{What do we mean by pointed here?  It appears we need to use the fact that $x_1^{-a_1}x_2^{-a_2}$ is the smallest monomial but do not need the (unproven) fact that there are gaps via $x_1^b$ and $x_2^c$. (Gregg)} at $(a_1,a_2)$ and that the Newton polygon of $z$ is contained in that of $x[a_1,a_2]$.  Suppose $z\ne x[a_1,a_2]$.  There exists a monomial $x_1^{-a'_1}x_2^{-a'_2}$ appearing in $z$ with a different coefficient than in $x[a_1,a_2]$.  Since $z$ is pointed at $(a_1,a_2)$, for any such monomial we have $a'_1<a_1$ or $a'_2<a_2$.  Choose a monomial with $(a'_1,a'_2)$ maximal in lexicographic order.  Then in the greedy basis expansion of $z$ the element $x[a'_1,a'_2]$ must appear with nonzero coefficient. 

  Below we refer to the points $O,A,B,C$ from Figure~\ref{fig:greedy polytopes}.  To reach a contradiction, there are two cases to consider.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $(a'_1,a'_2)$ lies on or North of the line segment $OB$, i.e. $a_1a'_2\le a'_1a_2$, then we consider the point $C'=(-a'_1,-a'_2+ca'_2)$ at the Northern boundary of the Newton polygon of $x[a'_1,a'_2]$ and compare with the line segment $OC$.  In this case, we have
    \[-a_1(-a'_2+ca'_1)=a_1a'_2-ca_1a'_1\le a'_1a_2-ca_1a'_1=-a'_1(-a_2+ca_1)\]
    and thus $C'$ lies on or North of $OC$.  If $C'$ is North of $OC$ or $C'\ne C$ is on $OC$, then it lies outside the Newton polygon of $z$ which is impossible.  Thus we must have $C'=C$, but this implies $(a'_1,a'_2)=(a_1,a_2)$ which is clearly false.
    \item If $(a'_1,a'_2)$ lies on or East of the line segment $OB$, i.e. $a'_1a_2\le a_1a'_2$, then we consider the point $A'=(-a'_1+ba'_2,-a'_2)$ at the Eastern boundary of the Newton polygon of $x[a'_1,a'_2]$ and compare with the line segment $OA$.  In this case, we have
    \[(-a'_1+ba'_2)(-a_2)=a'_1a_2-ba_2a'_2\le a_1a'_2-ba_2a'_2=(-a_1+ba_2)(-a'_2)\]
    and thus $A'$ lies on or East of $OA$.  If $A'$ is East of $OA$ or $A'\ne A$ is on $OA$, then it lies outside the Newton polygon of $z$ which is impossible.  Thus we must have $A'=A$, but this implies $(a'_1,a'_2)=(a_1,a_2)$ which is clearly false.
  \end{itemize}
  It follows that $z=x[a_1,a_2]$.
\end{proof}
The proof of Theorem~\ref{th:Newton polygons} actually establishes the following stronger result.
\begin{scholium}\label{sch}
  If $z\in\cA(b,c)$ is any element containing the monomial $x_1^{-a_1}x_2^{-a_2}$ with coefficient 1 and whose Newton polygon is contained in the half-open quadrilateral $OABC$ from Figure~\ref{fig:greedy polytopes} associated to $(a_1,a_2)$, then $z=x[a_1,a_2]$. 
\end{scholium}


\begin{remark}\label{rem:Dyck}
The existence of integers $c(p,q)$ satisfying the recursive equations \eqref{eq:greedy recursion}, and thus the existence of the greedy basis itself, is quite non-trivial.  The authors of \cite{LLZ} characterize each $c(p,q)$ as the solution to an enumerative problem; specifically, the number of certain `compatible pairs of edges' inside a type of lattice path called a `maximal Dyck path'.

This enumerative description not only establishes the existence of the greedy basis, but shows that the coefficients $c(p,q)$ are manifestly non-negative.  Finding naturally-defined bases for cluster algebras whose elements have positive coefficients has been one of the core goals of the theory since its inception.  %Many remarkable advances in the theory of cluster algebras have been animated by a desire to produce enumerative problems whose solutions define the coefficients of such a basis, such as additive and monodial categorifications,

%%%Dyck path comment begins here

%To prove Theorem~\ref{th:Newton polygons} Lee, Li, and Zelevinsky develop a
%combinatorial construction via compatible pairs on a maximal Dyck path.  
%
%For $(a_1,a_2)\in\ZZ_{\ge0}^2$, a Dyck path in the rectangle
%$[0,a_1]\times[0,a_2]$ is a lattice path beginning at $(0,0)$ which takes steps
%to the east and north to end at $(a_1,a_2)$ while never crossing above the main
%diagonal.  Let $D_{a_1,a_2}$ denote the maximal such Dyck path, i.e. any lattice
%point lying strictly above the Dyck path $D_{a_1,a_2}$ also lies above the main
%diagonal.  
%
%Let $H$ and $V$ denote the sets of horizontal and vertical edges of
%$D_{a_1,a_2}$.  For edges $e_1,e_2\in D_{a_1,a_2}$ write $e_1e_2$ for the
%subpath of $D_{a_1,a_2}$ which begins at $e_1$ and terminates at $e_2$.  When
%$e_1$ comes after $e_2$ the path $e_1e_2$ begins at $e_1$ goes to the end of
%$D_{a_1,a_2}$ and then continues from the beginning of $D_{a_1,a_2}$ to $e_2$.
%Write $(e_1e_2)_H$ and $(e_1e_2)_V$ for the sets of horizontal and vertical
%edges in $e_1e_2$.
%
%For $S_1\subset H$ and $S_2\subset V$ we call the pair $(S_1,S_2)$
%\emph{compatible} if for each $h\in S_1$ and $v\in S_2$ there exists an edge
%$e\in hv$ such that one of the following holds:

\section{Scattering diagrams and broken lines}
\saySS{Address whether our exchange matrix/g-vectors conventions are transposed to Fomin-Zelevinsky or not.}

In this section we describe the theta basis of a rank 2 cluster algebra.  
We use \cite{GHKK} as a reference, adapting 
the notation to the rank 2 situation.

%We fix lattices $N = \ZZ^2$ and $M = \Hom (N, \ZZ)$. We write their elements as tuples and denote the standard pairing of $m\in M$ and $n\in N$ as $n \cdot m$. We write $M_{\RR} = M\otimes\RR$, $N_{\RR} = N\otimes\RR$. Taking $\ZZ$ to be a field of characteristic 0, for $m\in M$ we will write $x^m$ for the monomial in $\ZZ[M]$.  For notational convenience we will write $x_1=x^{(1,0)}$ and $x_2=x^{(0,1)}$, thus we may identify $x^m$ with $x_1^{m_1}x_2^{m_2}$.

Recall from the previous section the lattice $M \cong \ZZ^2$ such that $\ZZ[M] \cong \ZZ[x_1^{\pm 1}, x_2^{\pm 1}]$.  We write $N = \Hom (M, \ZZ)$ for its dual lattice, $M_{\RR} = M\otimes\RR$, $N_{\RR} = N\otimes\RR$, and denote the standard pairing of $m\in M$ and $n\in N$ by $n \cdot m$.  Given a strictly convex rational cone $\sigma \subsetneq M_{\RR}$, we write $P=\sigma \cap M$.  Let $\widehat{\ZZ[P]}$ denote the completion of the monoid ring $\ZZ[P]$ at the maximal monomial ideal $\fm$ generated by $\left\{x^m \,|\, m\in P\smallsetminus\{0\}\right\}$. \sayHW{Unless it would be mathematically incorrect to do so, all $\ZZ$'s in the paper should be $\ZZ$'s [Mandy: changed. please check if anything goes wrong.]}

The following are special cases of definitions which originally appeared in
\cite{KS}, \cite{GS}.

\begin{defn}
  \label{walldef}
  A \emph{wall} is a pair $(\fd, f_{\fd})$, where 
  \begin{itemize}

    \item 
      $\fd \subset M_{\mathbb{R}}$ is either a ray $\RR_{\le 0} w$ or a line
      $\RR w$ with $w\in \sigma \cap(M\smallsetminus 0)$;

    \item 
      $f_{\fd} \in \widehat{\ZZ [P]}$ is such that 
      \[ 
        f_{\fd} = f_{\fd}(x^w) = 1 + \sum_{k\geq 1} c_k x^{k w},
      \] 
      for some $c_k \in \ZZ$. 
  \end{itemize}
  The set $\fd \subset M_{\mathbb{R}}$ is called the \emph{support} of the wall
  $(\fd, f_{\fd})$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
  \label{def:scattering_diagram}
  A scattering diagram $\fD$ is a collection of walls such that, for each $k \geq
  0$, the set
  \[
    \{ (\fd, f_{\fd}) \in \fD\, |\, f_{\fd} \neq 1 \bmod \fm^k \}
  \]
  is finite. The support of a scattering diagram is the union of the supports of its walls.%For semplicity we diverge slightly form the convention in
  %\cite{GHKK} by requiring that $\fd_1 \neq \fd_2$ whenever $f_{\fd_1}\neq
  %f_{\fd_2}$.
\end{defn}
For simplicity, we will impose the additional condition that $\fd_1\neq \fd_2$ for all pairs of walls in the scattering diagram.

%For a scattering diagram $\fD$, we denote the support of $\fD$ as
%\[
%  \text{Supp} (\fD) := \bigcup_{(\fd, f_{\fd}) \in \fD} \fd. 
%\]

Given a wall $(\fd, f_{\fd})$ and a direction $v$ transversal to $\fd$, we associate the element $\theta_{v,\fd}\in
{\mathrm{Aut}}_{\ZZ-alg}\left(\widehat{\ZZ[P]}\right)$ defined by
\[
  \theta_{v,\fd} (x^m) := x^m f_{\fd}^{m\cdot n }, 
\]
where $n\in N$ is primitive, annihilates the tangent space to $\fd$, and is
uniquely determined by the sign convention $ v\cdot n <0$.  Note
that the only role of the transversal direction $v$ is to fix which of the two
normals $\pm n$ is used in the exponent. 

Let $\fD$ be a scattering diagram and $\gamma$ a smooth immersion
\[  
  \gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow M_{\mathbb{R}} \smallsetminus  \{0 \}  
\]
transverse to each wall of $\fD$ that it crosses and with endpoints not in the support of $\fD$. We define the \textit{path-ordered product} $\theta_{\gamma, \fD}$ along $\gamma$ as follows. For each power $k \geq 1$, let  
\[
  0< t_1 <  t_2 < \cdots < t_s < 1 
\]
be the longest sequence of numbers such that $\gamma(t_i)\in\fd_i$ for some wall
$(\fd_i,f_{\fd_i}) \in \fD$ with $f_{\fd_i} \neq 1 \text{ mod } \fm^k$.  In view of the definition of scattering diagram, such a sequence is finite; we
can therefore consider the composition 
\[
  \theta^k_{\gamma, \fD} :=
  \theta_{\gamma'(t_s),\fd_s} \circ \cdots \circ \theta_{\gamma'(t_1),\fd_1}.
\]
Then we define
\[
  \theta_{\gamma, \fD} := \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \theta ^k_{\gamma, \fD}. 
\]

\begin{defn}
  A scattering diagram is \emph{consistent} if $\theta _{\gamma, \fD}$ depends
  only on the endpoints of $\gamma$ for any path $\gamma$ for which
  $\theta_{\gamma, \fD}$ is well defined.
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}\cite{KS},\cite{GS}
  \label{th:KS}
  Given any scattering diagram $\fD$, there exists a consistent scattering
  diagram $\fD'$ which contains $\fD$ such that $\fD'\smallsetminus\fD$ only consists
  of rays.
\end{theorem}

We now associate a consistent scattering diagram $\fD_{(b,c)}$ to 
$\cA(b,c)$.  Following Example 1.30 of \cite{GHKK}, we take $\sigma$ to be the second quadrant, i.e., the cone generated by $(-1,0)$ and
$(0,1)$. Define the ``initial'' scattering diagram associated $\cA(b,c)$ by
\[
  \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)} := 
  \left\{
    \big( \RR (-1,0), 1+x_1^{-b}\big), 
    \big( \RR (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big) 
  \right\}.
\]
We then denote by $\fD_{(b,c)}$ the consistent scattering diagram obtained by
applying Theorem \ref{th:KS} to $\fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$.  The case of $\fD_{(2,1)}$ is illustrated in \cref{fig:diagex}.

%\begin{example} 
%  \label{ex}
%Since
%  \[
%    \fD_{\mathrm{in},(2,1)} =  
%    \left\{ 
%      \big(\RR (-1,0), 1+x_1^{-2}\big), 
%      \big(\RR (0,1), 1+x_2\big)  
%    \right\}   
%  \]
%  the associated consistent scattering diagram $\fD_{(2,1)}$ (shown in
%  Figure~\ref{fig:diagex}) contains $\fD_{\mathrm{in},(2,1)}$ together with
%  the two walls
%  \[ 
%    \big( \RR_{\leq 0} (-1,1), 1+x_1^{-2}x_2^2 \big)
%    \quad \mbox{and} \quad
%    \big( \RR_{\leq 0} (-2,1), 1+x_1^{-2}x_2 \big).
%  \]} 
%\end{example}

\begin{figure}

    \draw (3,0) -- (-3,0) node[left] {$1+x_1^{-2}$};

    \draw (0,0) -- (3,-1.5) node[below right] {$1+x_1^{-2}x_2$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The scattering diagram $\fD_{(2,1)}$.  Since the initial diagram $\fD_{\mathrm{in},(2,1)}$ consists of the walls $\big(\RR(-1,0),\allowbreak 1+x_1^{-2}\big)$ and $\big(\RR (0,1), 1+x_2\big)$,
  the associated consistent scattering diagram $\fD_{(2,1)}$ contains $\fD_{\mathrm{in},(2,1)}$ together with
  the two walls $\big(\RR_{\leq 0} (-1,1), 1+x_1^{-2}x_2^2 \big)$ and $\big( \RR_{\leq 0} (-2,1), 1+x_1^{-2}x_2 \big)$.
  %\[

  %  \big( \RR_{\leq 0} (-2,1), 1+x_1^{-2}x_2 \big).
  %\]
} 
  \label{fig:diagex}
\end{figure}

For general $b$ and $c$, the diagram $\fD_{(b,c)}$ may consist of an infinite number of rays, and in fact
it is infinite precisely when $bc\ge 4$. A more detailed description of the rays
which appear can be found in \cite{GHKK}, Example 1.30, where the description
is based on the description of a related scattering diagram given in
\cite{GP}. We summarize the crucial points here.

First of all note that, in view of the definition of scattering diagram, all the
rays in  $\fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$ are contained in the
fourth quadrant.  To make our next observation we need to extend the action of
linear operators on $M_\RR$ to an action on pairs $(\fd,f_\fd)$. If $S$ is
linear on $M_\RR$ set
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:linear action}
  S(\fd,f_\fd(x^w))
  :=
  \left( S(\fd), f_\fd\left(x^{S(w)}\right) \right)
\end{equation}
Note that, even if $(\fd,f_\fd)$ is a wall, $S(\fd,f_\fd)$ needs not be a wall
since $S(w)$ may lay outside of the cone $\sigma$ (in which case we also get
that  $f_\fd\left(x^{S(w)}\right)$ is not an element of $\widehat{\ZZ [P]}$).

Now consider the two linear involutions $S_1$ and $S_2$ given by
\[
  S_1 =  
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -1 & -b \\
    0& 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  %
  \quad
  \mbox{and}
  \quad
  %
  S_2 =  
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    -c & -1
  \end{pmatrix}.
\]
If $(\fd, f_{\fd}) \in \fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$ and $S_i
(\fd)$ is contained strictly in the fourth quadrant, then $S_i(\fd, f_{\fd}) \in
\fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$. Moreover both 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:first-walls}
  S_2\big(\RR_{\leq 0}(-1,0),1+x_1^{-b}\big)
  %
  \quad
  \mbox{and}
  \quad
  %
  S_1\big(\RR_{\leq 0}(0,1),1+x_2^c\big)
\end{equation}
are walls in $\fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$ even though
neither 
\[
  \big(\RR_{\leq 0}(-1,0),1+x_1^{-b}\big)
  %
  \quad
  \mbox{nor}
  \quad
  %
  \big(\RR_{\leq 0}(0,1),1+x_2^c\big)
\]
are walls in $\fD_{(b,c)}$. These considerations gives us a recipe to produce
elements of $\fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$: it is enough to apply
alternatively $S_1$ and $S_2$ to the walls (\ref{eq:first-walls}).

We need to distinguish two cases. If $bc<4$ this procedure will construct, in
finitely many steps, all the walls in $\fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus
\fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$.  If $bc\ge 4$, instead, we will get two infinite
families of walls whose supports will converge to a single rational
ray if $bc=4$ or if $bc>4$, to the boundary of the convex cone
spanned by the irrational vectors
\[
  \left(2b,-bc + \sqrt{bc(bc-4)}\right)
  \quad
  \mbox{and}
  \quad
  \left(2b,-bc - \sqrt{bc(bc-4)}\right)
\]
These will exhaust all the walls in  $\fD_{(b,c)} \smallsetminus \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$
with support laying outside of this cone. The structure of the remaining part of 
$\fD_{(b,c)}$ is not completely understood; the expectation is that there is
a wall for each possible rational slope inside the irrational cone.

On the other hand the chamber structure one sees outside of the irrational cone
is very well-behaved and familiar in the theory of cluster algebras. This
chamber structure coincides with the Fock-Goncharov cluster complex, see
\cite[\S2]{GHKK}, the mutation fan of Reading \cite{R}, and the picture group of
Igusa-Orr-Todorov-Weyman \cite{IOTW}.

\begin{figure}
  \input{scatter32_depth100}
  \caption{The supports of all the walls $(\fd,f_\fd)$ in $\fD_{(3,2)}$ such
    that $f_\fd \neq 1 \bmod \fm^{100}$; the boundary rays of
    the irrational cone are highlighted.} 
  \label{diagram32}
\end{figure}

The following result explains the connection between scattering diagrams
and the corresponding cluster algebras: 
\begin{theorem} 
  \label{univLaurent} 
  Let $\fD:=\fD_{(b,c)}$ be as constructed above, and let $f \in \ZZ[M]$ be a
  Laurent polynomial. For any path $\gamma$ for which $\theta_{\gamma,\fD}$ is
  defined, $\theta_{\gamma,\fD}(f)$ can be viewed as an element of
  $\ZZ[[x_1,x_2^{-1}]]$ localized at $x_1x_2^{-1}$. Then $f$ is a universal
  Laurent polynomial if, for any path $\gamma$ in
  $M_{\RR}$ with starting point in the first quadrant and endpoint in one of the
  chambers of $\fD$, $\theta_{\gamma,\fD}(f)$ in fact lies in $\ZZ[M]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  This is \cite{GHKK}, Theorem 4.4, applied to the case at hand.
  Specifically, let $\cA$ be the custer variety defined by the given choice of
  seed. By definition, $\cA$ is given by gluing together a collection of tori
  via cluster transformations, and a regular function on $\cA$ is precisely a
  universal Laurent polynomial, i.e., a Laurent polynomial which remains a
  Laurent polynomial after any sequence of mutations. On the other hand, in
  \cite{GHKK}, \S 4, another variety $\cA'$ is defined. This is done by
  associating a torus $\cA_{\tau}':= \Spec \ZZ[M]$ to a chamber $\tau\subseteq
  M_{\RR}$ \sayMC{ check if still $\RR$} of $\fD$. For any two chambers $\tau,\tau'$ we can glue $\cA_{\tau}'$
  to $\cA_{\tau'}'$ using the rational map defined on function fields by
  $\theta_{\gamma,\fD}:\ZZ(x_1,x_2)\rightarrow \ZZ(x_1,x_2)$, where $\gamma$
  is a path beginning in $\tau'$ and ending in $\tau$. Performing these gluings
  gives $\cA'$.

  Now \cite{GHKK}, Theorem 4.4 gives an explicit isomorphism between $\cA$ and
  $\cA'$, and thus the algebra of regular functions on $\cA$ and $\cA'$ are
  isomorphic. Furthermore, this isomorphism restricts to the identity on the
  torus of $\cA$ corresponding to the initial seed and the torus of $\cA'$
  corresponding to the positive chamber. In particular, a function $f$ on this
  torus extends to a function on $\cA'$ if $\theta_{\gamma,\fD}(f)$ lies in
  $\ZZ[M]$ for any path $\gamma$ from the positive chamber to any other
  chamber. This shows the characterization of universal Laurent polynomials.
\end{proof}

We now recall the notion of broken lines, which are tropical analogues of holomorphic disks.  They were introduced in \cite{G10}, their theory was further developed in \cite{CPS}, and they were
used in \cite{GHK11} and \cite{GHKK} to construct canonical bases in various
circumstances.

\begin{defn} 
  \label{brokendef}
  Let $\fD$ be a scattering diagram, $m \in M \smallsetminus \{0\}$ and $q \in
  M_{\RR} \smallsetminus \text{Supp}(\fD)$.  A \emph{broken line} with initial
  \emph{exponent} $m$ and endpoint $q$ is a continuous and piecewise linear path
  $\gamma : ( - \infty , 0] \rightarrow M_{\mathbb{R}} \smallsetminus \{ 0\} $ with
  a finite number of domains of linearity, along with a choice of monomial
  $c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)} \in \ZZ[M]$ for each domain of linearity $\ell \subseteq ( -
  \infty, 0]$ of $\gamma$. 
  
  The path $\gamma$ and the monomials $c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)}$ need to satisfy the
  following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
      $\gamma(0) = q$.
    
    \item 
      If $\ell$ is the first (i.e., unbounded) domain of linearity of $\gamma$,
      then 
      \[
        c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)} = x^{m}.
      \]

    \item 
      For $t$ in a domain of linearity $\ell$, $\gamma'(t) = -m(\ell)$.

    \item 
      $\gamma$ bends only when it crosses a wall. If $\gamma$ bends from the
      domain of linearity $\ell$ to $ \ell'$ when crossing $(\fd, f_{\fd})$, then
      $c(\ell')x^{m(\ell')}$ is a term in 
      \[
        \theta_{-m(\ell), \fd} \left(c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)}\right).
      \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
We refer to $m(\ell)\in \mathbb{Z}^2$ as the \emph{exponent} of that domain
of linearity.

We are finally ready to introduce the main player of our discussion.
For a broken line $\gamma$  denote by
$\Mono (\gamma)$ the monomial attached to the last domain of linearity of $\gamma$.
\begin{defn}
  Let $\fD, m, q$ be as in Definition~\ref{brokendef}.  Define the \emph{theta function} corresponding to $m$ and $q$
  as
  \[ 
    \Theta_{q, m} = \sum_{\gamma} \Mono (\gamma), 
  \] 
  where the sum is over all broken lines with initial exponent $m$ and endpoint
  $q$.
\end{defn}

\begin{example} 
  \label{brokenex}
  Consider the scattering diagram $\fD_{(2,2)}$ and let $q$ be a small
  irrational perturbation of the point $(1.5,1)$. There are three broken lines
  with initial exponent $m = (1,-1)$ and endpoint $q$ as shown in
  Figure~\ref{figbrokenex}.
  First of all, we can have a broken line $\gamma_1$ which does not bend.
  Therefore
  \[
    \Mono(\gamma_1) = x_1 x_2^{-1}.
  \]
  There is the broken line $\gamma_2$  which bends only at the $x$-axis. Since
  \[ 
    \theta_{(-1,1), \RR(-1,0)} (x_1 x_2^{-1}) = 
    x_1 x_2^{-1}(1+x_1^{-2}) =  x_1 x_2^{-1} + x_1^{-1} x_2^{-1},
  \]
  to bend we need to choose the second term and obtain 
  \[
    \Mono(\gamma_2) =  x_1^{-1} x_2^{-1}.
  \]
  The last broken line $\gamma_3$ bends both at the $x$- and $y$-axes, the
  latter bend coming from
  \[ 
    \theta_{ (1,1), \RR (0,1)} ( x_1^{-1} x_2^{-1}) =  
    x_1^{-1} x_2^{-1} + x_1^{-1} x_2.  
  \]
  This time we have 
  \[
    \Mono (\gamma_3) = x_1^{-1} x_2.
  \]
  Thus the theta function associated to $m = (1,-1)$ with endpoint point $q$ is 
  \[ 
    \Theta_{q, (1,-1)} =  
    x_1 x_2^{-1} + x_1^{-1} x_2^{-1} +x_1^{-1} x_2 .  
  \]
\end{example}

The following summarizes the main properties of the theta functions as shown in
\cite{GHKK}:
\begin{theorem} $ $
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      If $\fD$ is any consistent scattering diagram, $q$, $q'$ are two general
      irrational points on $M_{\RR} \smallsetminus$ Supp$(\fD)$, and $\gamma$ is a
      path joining $q$ to $q'$, then the path-ordered product 
      \saySS{Reconsider this phrasing.}
      \[
        \theta_{\gamma, \fD }(\Theta_{q,m}) = \Theta_{q', m}. 
      \]
    
    \item 
      Taking $\fD=\fD_{(b,c)}$, if $q$ lies in the interior of a chamber of
      $\fD$, then $\Theta_{q,m}$ is a Laurent polynomial for any $m$.
    
    \item 
      Taking $\fD=\fD_{(b,c)}$, if $q$ lies in the interior of the first
      quadrant, then $\Theta_{q,m}$ is a universal Laurent polynomial for
      any $m$.

    \item 
      Taking $\fD=\fD_{(b,c)}$, if $m$ lies in the interior of a chamber of
      $\fD$, and $q$ lies in the same chamber, then $\Theta_{q,m}=x^{m}$.
   
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  (1) is a main result of \cite{CPS}, quoted in this context in \cite{GHKK},
  Theorem 3.5.  The second statement is \cite{GHKK}, Example 7.18: there,
  $\Theta$ is the subset of $M$ consisting of those $m$ for which
  $\Theta_{q,m}$ is a Laurent polynomial for $q$ in the interior of 
  some chamber of $\fD$ (and hence by \cite{GHKK}, Proposition 7.1, all 
  chambers).
  Next, (3) follows from (2) by Theorem \ref{univLaurent}. 
  Finally, (4) follows from \cite{GHKK}, Proposition 3.8 (use the argument of
  \cite{GHKK}, Theorem 4.8 in the case that the chamber is not the positive
  quadrant.)
\end{proof}

\begin{remark} 
  \label{rk:theta functions g-vector}
  If $m\in M$ lies in one of the chambers of $\fD_{(b,c)}$, and $q$ lies in
  the first quadrant, then from (1) and (4) of the above theorem,
  $\Theta_{q,m}=\theta_{\gamma,\fD_{(b,c)}}(x^{m})$ for a path $\gamma$
  joining the chamber containing $m$ to $q$. Moreover it follows from the
  details of the proof of Theorem \ref{univLaurent} that $\Theta_{q,m}$ is
  a cluster monomial, and from \cite{GHKK}, Theorem 7.5, that the 
  $\bfg$-vector of this cluster monomial is precisely $m$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  Let us try one more calculation with broken lines. We take the same scattering
  diagram as in example~\ref{brokenex}. Now take the initial exponent $m=(2,-2)$
  with the same endpoint $q$. By similar calculations we get 
  \[ 
    \Theta _{q, (2,-2)} = 
    x_1^2 x_2^{-2} + x_1^{-2}x_2^2 + x_1^{-2}x_2^{-2} + 2 x_2^{-2} + 2x_1^{-2}.  
  \]
  Note that 
  \[ 
    \Theta _{q, (2,-2)} = 
    \left(\Theta_{q, (1,-1)}\right) ^2 -2. 
  \]
  In this scattering diagram $\fD_{(2,2)}$, the ray with exponent $(1,-1)$ does
  not lie in the interior of any chamber. So neither $\Theta_{q,(1,-1)}$ nor 
  $\Theta _{q, (2,-2)}$ are cluster monomials.

  There are a number of known bases for $\cA(2,2)$, which give different results
  for the basis elements with $\bfg$-vectors $(d,-d)$ for $d>0$. Our
  calculations shows that at least for $d=1$ or $2$, theta functions agree with
  the greedy basis elements.
\end{example}


\section{From $\bfg$-vectors to $\bfd$-vectors}
%\saySS{At a certain point in our discussion in Snowbird we decided we were going
%  to use the scattering diagram $\fD_{\mathrm{gr},(b,c)}$ instead of
%  $-\fD_{\mathrm{gr},(b,c)}$ because we would have the base point $q$ in the
%  first quadrant and most of the rays in the third one. By doing so we get that
%  theta functions in $\fD_{\mathrm{gr},(b,c)}$ are parametrized by the
%  \emph{negative} of their $\bfd$-vectors. On the other hand, in
%  $\fD_{(b,c)}$ theta functions are parametrized by their $\bfg$-vectors.
%  This is slightly counterintuitive, maybe it is  more natural to change
%  our convention.}
%\sayMG{I would be slightly inclined to stick with the convention we
%  are currently using in the paper, as it is a less drastic change
%  from what is used in GHKK}
As mentioned in Remark \ref{rk:theta functions g-vector}, theta functions are
parametrized by their $\bfg$-vectors. On the other hand the description of
greedy elements given in \cite{LLZ} is in terms of their $\bfd$-vectors (cf.
Remark 1.9 ibid.). 

In order to compare the two we will leverage the observation that, in rank 2,
these families of vectors are related by an easy piecewise-linear transformation
as explained in the paragraph following Conjecture 3.21 in \cite{RS}. We will do
so via a scattering diagram $\fD^{\bfd}_{(b,c)}$ closely related to
$\fD_{(b,c)}$.

Let $T:M_\RR\rightarrow M_\RR$ be the piecewise-linear map given by
\[
  T (m) := 
  \begin{cases}
    m   & m_2 \geq 0 \\
    m + (bm_2,0), & m_2 \leq 0.
  \end{cases}
\]
We will denote its domains of linearity by 
\[ 
  \mathcal{H}_{+} := 
  \left\{ m \in M_{\mathbb{R}}\, |\, m_2 \geq 0 \right\} 
  \quad
  \mbox{and}
  \quad
  \mathcal{H}_{-} := 
  \left\{ m \in M_{\mathbb{R}} \,|\, m_2 \leq 0 \right\}.
\]
Let $T_+$ and $T_-$ be the linear extensions to $M_\RR$ of $T|_{\mathcal{H}_+}$
and $T|_{\mathcal{H}_-}$ respectively ($T_+$ is just the identity map but it
will be convenient to use this notation in what follows). 
By (\ref{eqn:linear action}) both $T_+$ and $T_-$ act on pairs $(\fd,f_\fd)$ so
we can use them to define the image of such pairs under $T$. Namely set
\[
  T(\fd,f_\fd):=
  \left\{
    T_+\left(\fd\cap\mathcal{H}_+,f_\fd\right),
    T_-\left(\fd\cap\mathcal{H}_-,f_\fd\right)
  \right\}.
\]

Having fixed the notation we are ready to introduce $\fD_{\mathrm{gr},(b,c)}$.
The set
\[
  T(\fD_{(b,c)}):=
  \left\{
    T(\fd,f_\fd)\, |\, (\fd,f_\fd)\in \fD_{(b,c)}
  \right\}
\]
is not a scattering diagram according to Definition 
\ref{def:scattering_diagram} (not all of its elements are walls for the same
convex cone) but can be made into one by few quick fixes.

First of all $\big( \RR (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big)$ is the only wall of $\fD_{(b,c)}$
whose support is not totally contained in one of the domains of linearity of
$T$; therefore, under $T$, it breaks into two parts:
\[
  \big( \RR_{\ge0} (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big)
  \quad
  \mbox{and}
  \quad
  \big( \RR_{\le 0} (b,1), 1+x_1^{bc}x_2^c\big).
\]

Next note that, since $T(-1,0)=(-1,0)$ and $T(b,-1)=(0,-1)$, $T$ maps all the
walls of $\fD_{(b,c)}\smallsetminus\fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$ to the third quadrant. 
Indeed 
\[
  \big(\RR_{\leq0}(-b,1),1+x_1^{-bc}x_2^c\big)
\]
is the wall with the biggest slope in
$\fD_{(b,c)}\smallsetminus\fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}$ and its image is 
\[
  \big( \RR_{\le0} (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big).
\]

\begin{defn}
  $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$ is the scattering diagram obtained from
  $T\left(\fD_{(b,c)}\right)$ by replacing 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      $\big(\RR (-1,0), 1+x_1^{-b}\big)$ with $\big(\RR  (1,0), 1+x_1^b\big)$,
    \item 
      both $ \big( \RR_{\ge0} (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big)$ and $\big( \RR_{\le0} (0,1),
      1+x_2^c\big)$ with $ \big( \RR (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big)$.
  \end{itemize}
  Its base region is the cone $\sigma^\bfd$ generated by $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
  It is not too hard to see that the scattering diagram $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$ is
  consistent. This fact, together with the uniqueness property implied by
  \cite[Theorem 1.7]{GHKK}, gives an alternative way to introduce it. Indeed, in
  analogy with the definition of $\fD_{(b,c)}$, one could consider the
  scattering diagram
  $\fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}^\bfd$ given by 
  \[
    \fD_{\mathrm{in},(b,c)}^\bfd=
    \left\{
      \big(\RR (1,0), 1+x_1^b\big), 
      \big(\RR (0,1), 1+x_2^c\big)
    \right\}
  \]
  and obtain $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$ using Theorem \ref{th:KS}. 
\end{remark}

For a broken line $\gamma$ in $\fD_{(b,c)}$, we denote its image under $T$ as
$T(\gamma)$: this is the broken line in $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$ whose underlying map
is $\gamma\circ T$. Given any domain of linearity $\ell$ of $\gamma$, by
subdividing it when necessary, we can always assume that either $\gamma(\ell)
\subset \mathcal{H}_{+} $ or $\gamma(\ell)\subset \mathcal{H}_{-}$. The monomial
attached to $\ell$ in $T(\gamma)$ is then obtained by applying, accordingly, either
$T_+$ or $T_-$ to the exponent of the monomial attached to $\ell$ in $\gamma$.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:T_on_broken_lines}
  The map $T$ defines a one-to-one correspondence between broken lines in $\fD_{(b,c)}$
  for $m$ with endpoint $q$ and broken lines in $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$ for $T(m)$
  with endpoint $T(q)$. In particular for $q \in \mathcal{H}_+$ or $\mathcal{H}_-$,
  we have
  \[ 
    \Theta^\bfd_{T(q),T( m)} = 
    T_{+} \left(\Theta_{q, m}\right) 
    \quad
    \mbox{or} 
    \quad
    T_{-} \left(\Theta_{q, m}\right)
  \]
  respectively.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  This is essentially the same as the argument of \cite{GHKK}, Prop.\ 3.6.  To
  prove the statement, we only need to check the bending at the $x$-axis. Let
  $\ell$, $\ell'$ be the domains of linearity of $\gamma$ before and after bending
  along $\RR (-1,0)$. So $c(\ell') x^{m(\ell')}$ is a term in 
  \[
    \theta_{-m(\ell),\RR(-1,0)} \left(c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)}\right)
    = 
    c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)} \left(1+x_1^{-b}\right) ^{|m_2(\ell)|}.
  \]

  First, assume $\gamma$ passes from $\mathcal{H}_-$ to $\mathcal{H}_+$. In this
  case, we have $m_2(\ell) < 0$. Now in order for the monomial
  $c(\ell')x^{T_+(m(\ell'))} =c(\ell')x^{m(\ell')}$ attached to $\ell'$ in
  $T\circ\gamma$ to satisfy the bending rule, it must be a term in
  \[
    \theta_{-T_-(m(\ell)),\RR (1,0)} \left(c(\ell) x^{T_-(m(\ell))}\right). 
  \]
  Since the second component of $T_-(m(\ell))$ is $m_2(\ell)$ we get
  \begin{align*} 
    \theta_{-T_-(m(\ell)),\RR (1,0)} \left(c(\ell) x^{T_-(m(\ell))}\right) 
    & =
    c(\ell) x^{T_-(m(\ell))} \left(1+x_1^b\right) ^{-m_2(\ell)}
    \\
    & = 
    c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)} x_1^{b m_2(\ell)} 
    \left(1+x_1^b\right)^{-m_2(\ell)} 
    \\
    & = 
    c(\ell) x^{m(\ell)} \left(1+x_1^{-b}\right) ^{-m_2(\ell)}.
  \end{align*}
  This shows that $T_k(\gamma)$ satisfies the correct rule when bending along
  $(\RR (1,0), 1+x_1^b)$ if $\gamma$ passes from $\mathcal{H}_-$ to
  $\mathcal{H}_+$. By repeating similar calculations, we can see that this also
  holds when $\gamma$ passes from $\mathcal{H}_+$ to $\mathcal{H}_-$.
\end{proof}

The following demonstrates the utility of using $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$:

\begin{prop}
  For any  $m\in M$, if $q$ lies in the first quadrant, then 
  \[
    \Theta^\bfd_{q, m}=x^{m}\left(1+f(x_1,x_2)\right)
  \]
  where $f\in (x_1,x_2)\subseteq \Bbbk[x_1,x_2]$.
  In particular, $m$ is the negative of the $\bfd$-vector of
  $\Theta^\bfd_{q,m}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  For any $m\in M$ and any $q$ in the first quadrant, there is always a broken
  line $\gamma$ for $m$ and $q$ that does not bend at any wall. Therefore $\Mono
  (\gamma) = x^{m}$ always appears as a term in $\Theta^\bfd_{q,m}$.

  However, because the functions attached to the walls of
  $\fD_{(b,c)}^\bfd$ are all of the form $1+g(x_1,x_2)$ with $g(x_1,x_2) \in
  (x_1,x_2) \subseteq \Bbbk[[x_1,x_2]]$, it follows that any term coming from a
  broken line which bends must be of the form $cx^{m}x_1^{d_1}x_2^{d_2}$ with
  $d_1,d_2\ge 0$, $d_1+d_2>0$. This proves the result.
\end{proof}

%\sayMG{It might be appropriate to add stuff about the quantum version here.
%  Right now I don't know if we can easily prove enough facts about the quantum

\begin{remark}
  Combining Theorem \ref{thm:T_on_broken_lines} with the above result, when $q$
  is in the first quadrant we obtain the parametrization of
  theta functions we were after. Indeed we get 
  \[
    \Theta^\bfd_{q,T(m)}=\Theta_{q,m}
  \]
  with $m$ being its $\bfg$-vector and $T(m)$ the negative of its 
  $\bfd$-vector.

\section{Proof that the bases coincide}

We may now state the main theorem in our current notation.

\begin{thm}\label{thm: main}
For any integers $b,c>0$, for each $m=(m_1,m_2)\in \mathbb{Z}^2$, and for each
generic point $q$ in the first quadrant, we have that 
\[ \Theta_{q,m}^{\mathbf{d}} = x[-m_1,-m_2]\]
as elements in the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}(b,c)$.  Hence, the greedy basis and the theta basis for $\mathcal{A}(b,c)$ coincide.
\end{thm}

The proof will be to show that $\Theta_{q,m}^{\mathbf{d}}$ is a pointed element with the same Newton polygon \sayGM{1) do we mean 'pointed element', same issue as in proof of Thm \ref{th:Newton polygons}  2) need to use 'support' rather than 'Newton polygon'.} as $x[-m_1,-m_2]$.  By Scholium \ref{sch}, this is already enough to show that $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}=x[-m_1,-m_2]$.

Let $\gamma$ be a broken line in $\mathfrak{D}_{(b,c)}^\mathbf{d}$.  At any point $q=(q_1,q_2)\in \gamma$ at which $\gamma$ is linear with exponent $m=(m_1,m_2)$, define the \emph{angular momentum} of $\gamma$ at $q$ to be $q_2m_1-q_1m_2$.

\begin{lemma}
The angular momentum is constant on $\gamma$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $q$ and $q'$ be two points on $\gamma$.
First, assume that $q=(q_1,q_2)$ and $q'=(q_1',q_2')$ are in the same linear region of $\gamma$, with exponent $m=(m_1,m_2)$.  Since $\gamma'=-m$ at $q$, there is some $t$ such that 
\[ (q_1',q_2') = (q_1+tm_1,q_2+tm_2) \]
Then the angular momentum at $q'$ is 
\[ (q_2+tm_2)m_1-(q_1+tm_1)m_2 = q_2m_1 - q_1m_2 \]

Next, assume that $q$ and $q'$ are points on $\gamma$ on either side of a bend at a wall $(\fd, f_{\fd})$ at point $q''=(q_1'',q_2'')$.  If the exponent of $\gamma$ at $q$ is $m=(m_1,m_2)$ and $f_{\fd}$ is a series in $x^{(w_1,w_2)}$, then the exponent of $\gamma$ at $q'$ must be of the form $(m_1+kw_1,m_2+kw_2)$ for some positive integer $k$.  By the argument of the previous paragraph, the angular momentum at $q$ is $q_2''m_1-q_1''m_2$
and the angular momentum at $q'$ is
\[ q_2''(m_1+kw_1)-q_1''(m_2+kw_2) = (q_2''m_1-q_1''m_2)+k(q_2''w_1-q_1''w_2) \]
Since the point $(q_1'',q_2'')$ lies on the ray through $(w_1,w_2)$, the expression $q_2''w_1-q_1''w_2$ is zero, and so the angular momenta at $q$ and $q'$ are the same.  This equality extends transitively to any pair of points $q,q'$ on $\gamma$.
\end{proof}
The sign of the angular momentum is a useful invariant for characterizing the qualitative behavior of a broken line.
For a broken line ending in the first quadrant, the sign of the angular momentum characterizes whether that broken line could have passed through the fourth quadrant (positive) or the second quadrant (negative).

\begin{lemma}
Let $\gamma$ be a broken line $\mathfrak{D}_{(b,c)}^{\mathbf{d}}$ with endpoint $q$ in the first quadrant. If $\gamma$ has positive (respectively, negative) angular momentum, then the slope of the linear domains of $\gamma$ decreases (resp. increases) at each bend, except possibly at the boundary of the first quadrant. 
%\begin{itemize}	
	%\item If $\gamma$ has positive angular momentum, then the slope of the linear domains of $\gamma$ decreases at each bend, except possibly at the boundary of the first quadrant.
	%\item If $\gamma$ has negative angular momentum, then the slope of the linear domains of $\gamma$ increases at each bend, except possibly at the boundary of the first quadrant.
%\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The lemma is straightforward except for broken lines with initial exponent $(m_1,m_2)$ with $m_1,m_2>0$.  
Consider a bend of $\gamma$ at a point $(q_1,q_2)$ in a wall $(\fd,f_{\fd}(x^{(w_1,w_2)}))$.  If the exponent immediately before the bend is $(m_1,m_2)$, the exponent immediately after the bend is $(m_1+kw_1,m_2+kw_2)$ for some positive integer $k$.  

Assume that $(q_1,q_2)$ is not in the boundary of the first quadrant, so that $(q_1,q_2)$ is a negative scalar multiple of the exponent $(w_1,w_2)$. If the angular momentum $q_2m_1-q_1m_2$ is positive, then the cross-product $w_2m_1-w_1m_2$ is negative. 
\[ w_2m_1-w_1m_2=m_1(m_2+kw_2)-m_2(m_1+kw_1)<0 \Rightarrow \frac{m_2+kw_2}{m_1+kw_1} < \frac{m_2}{m_1}\]
If the angular momentum is negative, the slope increases by the an identical argument.
\end{proof}

We can now constrain the possible final exponent of a broken line, which will be used to bound the Newton polygon of the corresponding theta function.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\gamma$ be a broken line in $\mathfrak{D}_{(b,c)}^{\mathbf{d}}$ which begins in the third quadrant, with endpoint $q$ in the first quadrant.  Denote the  initial exponent by $m=(m_1,m_2)$ and the final exponent by $m^q=(m_1^q,m_2^q)$.  
\begin{enumerate}
	%\item $m_1-m_1^q\in b\mathbb{N}$ and $m_2-m_2^q\in c\mathbb{N}$.%\footnote{Are the $b$ and $c$ correct here?}
	\item If $\gamma$ has positive angular momentum, then $m_2\leq m_2^q<0$ and
	\[ m_1\leq m_1^q\leq\left( \frac{m_1}{m_2}-b\right)m_2^q\]
	where the upper bound is equality only when $m^q =( m_1-bm_2,m_2)$.
	\item If $\gamma$ has negative angular momentum, then $m_1\leq  m_1^q<0$ and
	\[ m_2 \leq m_2^q\leq\left( \frac{m_2}{m_1}-c\right)m_1^q\]
	where the upper bound is equality only when $m^q =( m_1,m_2-cm_1)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Assume $\gamma$ has positive angular momentum; consequently, $\gamma$ passes through the fourth quadrant before entering the first quadrant.  Let $(m_1',m_2')$ be the exponent on $\gamma$ in the fourth quadrant.  By the preceding lemma, $\frac{m_2'}{m_1'}\leq \frac{m_2}{m_1}$ with equality only if $\gamma$ doesn't bend before it reaches the fourth quadrant.  

As the broken line passes into the first quadrant, it may bend at the wall $(\mathbb{R}(1,0),1+x^{(b,0)})$.  By definition, the final exponent $m^q$ on $\gamma$ must be an exponent that appears in $x^{(m_1',m_2')}(1+x^{(b,0)})^{-m_2'}$.  It follows that%The possible monomials which may occur in this expression are of the form $A^{(-m_1'+kb,-m_2')}$ for some $0\leq k\leq m_2'$, and so 
\[ (m_1^q,m_2^q) = (m_1'+kb,m_2')\]
for some $0\leq k\leq -m_2'$.
Consequently, $m_2^q=m_2'\leq0$ and 
\[ m_1^q\leq m_1' - bm_2' = \left(\frac{m_1'}{m_2'} - b\right) m_2'  = \left(\frac{m_1'}{m_2'} - b\right) m_2^q \leq \left(\frac{m_1}{m_2} - b\right) m_2^q\]
The second inequality is equality only if $(m_1',m_2')=(m_1,m_2)$, and so the composite inequality is equality only if $m^q =( m_1-bm_2,m_2)$.

Analogous inequalities hold for negative angular momentum by the same argument.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm: main}]
\sayGM{SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF This proof needs: a restatement of Theorem \ref{sch} which doesn't say `pointed' and only requires the right inequalities.}

If $m=(m_1,m_2)$ such that $m_1\leq0$ or $m_2\leq0$, then $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbb{d}$ is the cluster monomial $x[-m_1,-m_2]$, by Remark \ref{rk:theta functions g-vector}.

Next, assume that $m=(m_1,m_2)$ such that $m_1\geq0$ and $m_2\geq0$.
%\saySS{Shouldn't $a$ be $c$ instead?}
%\[ 0<m_1,\;\;\; 0<m_2\]
The coefficient of $x^{(a_1,a_2)}$ in $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}$ can have non-zero coefficient only if there is a broken line $\gamma$ in $\mathfrak{D}^\mathbf{d}_{(b,c)}$ with initial exponent $m$ and final exponent $a=(a_1,a_2)$.  By the preceding lemma, this implies that 
\[ m_1\leq a_1\leq \left(\frac{m_1}{m_2}-b\right)a_2,\;\;\; m_2\leq a_2\leq \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}-c\right)a_1\]
Furthermore, the upper bounds are only satisfied in the specific cases when $(a_1,a_2)$ is equal to $(a_1-ba_2,a_2)$ or $(a_1,a_2-ca_1)$.  
Since $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}\in \mathcal{A}_{b,c}$, Scholium \ref{sch} implies that $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}$ is a scalar multiple of $x[-m_1,-m_2]$. 

To show they coincide, we consider the coefficient of $x^{(m_1,m_2)}$ in each element.  The coefficient of $x^{(m_1,m_2)}$ in $x[-m_1,-m_2]$ is $1$, by the definition of a pointed element. The coefficient of $x^{(m_1,m_2)}$ in $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}$ is the sum of the coefficients of all broken lines in $\mathfrak{D}_{(b,c)}^\mathbf{d}$ with initial exponent $(m_1,m_2)$ and final exponent $(m_1,m_2)$.  Since any bend in a broken line would increase one of the components of the exponent, this only happens for the unique broken line with initial exponent $(m_1,m_2)$ that has no bends. Hence, the coefficient of $x^{(m_1,m_2)}$ in $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}$ is $1$, and so $\Theta_{q,m}^\mathbf{d}=x[-m_1,-m_2]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
As mentioned in Remark \ref{rem:Dyck}, the coefficients of $x[-m_1,-m_2]$ may be interpreted as counting `compatible pairs' in a lattice path called a `maximal Dyck path'.  One consequence of Theorem \ref{thm: main} is that the coefficients $c(p,q)$ are equal to a weighted sum of certain broken lines.  An interesting open problem is to reprove the equality of the two bases by giving a combinatorial bijection between broken lines and compatible pairs which directly proves the equality of the respective coefficients.
